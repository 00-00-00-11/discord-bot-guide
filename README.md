## Discord Bot Guide

Thanks for checking out our github page! The Discord Bot Guide was orginially created by [ThatGuyJamal](https://github.com/ThatGuyJamal). He is a fellow software enginner and Highschool student.

## Getting Started

The best way to enjoy our documentation is on the [official website](https://github.com/DeepWebDevelopers/discord-bot-guide). While it is possible to look though the documentation on github, we dont recommend it as we did not code the site for _code only_ readability.

### Want to support us?

You can join our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/NbqBQbaejS) for the lasted information about the docs and support on it.
