## Goals

Goals...something that everyone must have in life. A few of mine included become a better developer and graduating from school fast. As I become more advanced with CS I hope to build my own mobile and and maybe game.

Some short term goals would included: leanring javascript, python, typescript, nodejs, reactjs, and more. While I know the basics of them you can never know eveything right?
