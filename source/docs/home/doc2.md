## Become a Contributor

**_Hey there! Want to contribute to the documentation?_**

Thats great, the project is in beta also we are always looking to add to contributors.

### Things to know

**One:** You must have the [Discord](https://discord.com/) app and a [Github](https://github.com/) account to join the team. These are both applications we will be using daily.

**Two:** You must have some knowledge of programming in at least - `javascript, python, java` or another Discord Supported language. We are looking for people who are capable of teaching others how to learn, this means you must have a strong understanding of the content before hand.

_If you dont know the whole discord framework you can still learn as we go, we just dont want extreme begginers._

**Three:** you must be thirteen years or older to apply. **Why?** Mainly becuase we want older people who can commit to the project. Also Discord does not allow people younger than 13 on there platform.
