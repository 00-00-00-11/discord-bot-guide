## Hello from [DeepWebDevelopers](https://github.com/DeepWebDevelopers)

Before we venture on our journey to becoming amazing Discord Developers you must understand some important concepts about the documentation.

We are writing from the perspective of _"you already understand the basics"_.
This means, although we will explain and walk you through the concepts, you will **not** be taught the fundamentals of programming. Such as variables, functions, etc. So make sure you have a basic knowledge of your language before jumping into creating a Discord bot.

### Resources

If you want to sharpen your skills before starting the docs we can remcomend a few resources.

- [FreeCodeCamp - Many Different languages](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- [Node chool - Useful Javascript and nodejs information](https://nodeschool.io/)
- [Udemy- Great Courses for Languages](https://www.udemy.com/)
- [Learn python](https://www.learnpython.org/)
- [Or just use google!](https://www.google.com)

After learning your language on a basic level you can have a lot more fun with the documentation!
