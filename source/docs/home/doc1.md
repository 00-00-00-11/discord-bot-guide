## Hello from DeepWebDevelopers

Before we venture on our journery to becoming amazing Discord Developers you must understand some important concepts about the documentation.

Are are writing from the perspective of _you know the basics always_.
This means, although we will explain and walk you though the lesson, you will be taught the fundementals of programming. Such as variables, functions, etc. So many sure you have a basic knowledge of thoughs things before jumping into creating a Discord bot.

### Resources

If you want to sharpen your skillsbefore jumping into the docs I can remcomend a few resources.

- [FreeCodeCamp - Many Different languages](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- [Node chool - Useful Javascript and nodejs information](nodeschool.io/)
- [Learn python](https://www.learnpython.org/)
- [Or just use google!](https://www.google.com)

After learning your language on a basic level you can have a lot more fun with the documentation!
